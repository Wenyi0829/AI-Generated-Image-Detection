# Neighboring Pixel Relationships (NPR) for AI-Generated Image Detection

A novel deepfake detection approach that analyzes upsampling artifacts in AI-generated images through neighboring pixel relationships.

## 📖 Overview

This method implements the NPR (Neighboring Pixel Relationships) method for detecting AI-generated images by analyzing the characteristic artifacts left by upsampling operations in generative model pipelines. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple generative models.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-scale NPR Analysis**: Captures upsampling artifacts at different scales
- **Channel Attention Mechanism**: Adaptively focuses on discriminative color channels
- **Spatial Attention**: Identifies regions with prominent artifacts
- **ResNet50 Backbone**: Leverages pre-trained features for robust detection
- **Cross-Model Generalization**: Effective across 7 different generative models
